    "A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a statistical method used in data science to compare two versions of a product, webpage, or marketing campaign to determine which one performs better based on a specific metric. This approach allows data scientists and marketers to make data-driven decisions rather than relying on intuition or guesswork."
