Tmux, short for terminal multiplexer, is a powerful tool used primarily in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window, enhancing productivity and multitasking capabilities.

```bash
# start tmux
tmux

# create new window
# ctrl + B -> C

# move to next window
# ctrl + B -> N

# move to specific window
# ctrl + B -> 0, 1, 2, 3

# split pane vertical
# ctrl + B -> %

# split pane horizontal
# ctrl + B -> "

# move around panes
# ctrl + B -> arrows

# command mode
# ctrl + B -> :
# rename-window <window_name>
# rename-session <session_name>

# detach
# ctrl + B -> D

# list sessions
# ctrl + B -> s
tmux ls

# attach to existing session
tmux attach

# create new session
# detach
tmux

```
