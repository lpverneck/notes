Provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

## Benefits

- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
- Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
- Triggering build and publish processes.
- Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.

## Commit Template

The commit message should have the following structure:

```
<type>(<optional scope>)<!>: <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer(s)>
```

## Commit Types

| Commit Type | Title                    | Description                                                                                                 | Icon  |

## Specification

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, `feat`, `fix`, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL `!`, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
2. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
3. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
4. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(parser):`
5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., _fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string_.
6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
7. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
8. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a `:` or `#` separator, followed by a string value.
9. A footer’s token MUST use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g., `Acked-by` (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which MAY also be used as a token.
10. A footer’s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
11. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
12. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., _BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files_.
13. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
14. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., _docs: update ref docs._
15. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
16. BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.
