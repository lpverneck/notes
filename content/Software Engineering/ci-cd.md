It's a important foundation for a modern software development process. Because it automates the software development process, from coding through deployment.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. Each change is automatically built and tested, helping to catch bugs early and ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** Automates the process of preparing code for release, so it can be deployed to production at any time, usually requiring a manual approval step.

Most common CI/CD used tools:

- GitHub Actions
- CircleCI
- GitLab
